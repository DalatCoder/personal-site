- ✅ **Browser Testing:** Simple Browser preview confirmed functionality
- ✅ **CSS Validation:** QR classes present in minified output
- ✅ **No Build Errors:** Clean compilation with PostCSS and cssnano

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Before (Complex Scanner):
```css
/* Complex animations removed */
@keyframes scanHorizontal, scanVertical, glowPulse, statusBlink
.scanner-frame with complex hover effects
Multiple animated overlays and status indicators
```

#### After (Simplified Scanner):
```css
/* Clean, stable design */
.qr-frame-simple {
  width: 280px;
  height: 280px;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  border-radius: 25px;
  /* Simple glass morphism effect */
}

.qr-corners .corner {
  border: 3px solid #4facfe;
  /* Basic corner indicators */
}

.scan-indicator {
  /* Simple text indicator */
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
}
```
